# Graphing Calculator 

This is a Java-based 2D graphing calculator modeled after Desmos, created as part of a software systems development course. It renders mathematical functions such as polynomials, trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), and logarithmic functions, along with their:

- First and second derivatives
- X-intercepts (roots)
- Critical points
- Inflection points

The calculator uses `Java Swing` for GUI rendering and `Graphics2D` for drawing on a Cartesian grid.

## âœ¨ Features

- Draws 2D graphs with a labeled Cartesian plane
- Zoom in/out controls
- Dynamically parse and evaluate functions
- Highlights key points (roots, critical, inflection)
- Supports input like:
  - `x^2 + 2x + 1`
  - `sin(x)`
  - `cos(x)`
  - `tan(x)`
  - `ln(x)`
